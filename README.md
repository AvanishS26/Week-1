# Week-1
Traditional water quality monitoring is too slow and expensive to provide timely warnings for toxic Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). This project will build a fast, low-cost Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that instantly classifies a water photo as healthy-water or algae-bloom to serve as a rapid, accessible early-warning system.
